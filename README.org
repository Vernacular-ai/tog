Tagging interface for NLP-ish data. Specifically for entity region tagging as
shown here:

[[file:./screen-tagged.png]]


For tagging, you can either install this package or just run Emacs standalone
and load only tog (and its dependencies). Following steps are needed to do the
later:

1. Install Emacs and [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]].
2. In this directory run ~cask install~ to install dependencies locally.
3. Run ~./tog.sh~
