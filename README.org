A hackable data-tagging framework for (mostly) natural language data.

For tagging, you can either install this package or just run Emacs standalone
and load only tog (and its dependencies). Following steps are needed to do the
later:

1. Install Emacs and [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]].
2. In this directory run ~cask install~ to install dependencies locally.
3. Check ~./init.el~.

You might need to build Emacs (>= 27.0) with native json support. For older
versions we can have polyfills for few ~json-read*~ functions but it's not high on
priority as of now.
